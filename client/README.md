# Machine Learning - Recharts - Playground
Speaking of data visualization there are many charting heroics out there but not all can cope with . Some time ago after giving a try with few others, wanted to explore [Recharts](http://recharts.org/) on visualizing machine learning type data. Developed a mini project focused mainly on line and bar chart for time series data. Theme colors and some fundamental chart components are customizable to see how it looks like with different data.
